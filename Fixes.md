## Fix 1 — TC_PN_19: Missing image upload caused `#customlink_error` to never appear

**File:** `tests/e2e/push-notification.spec.ts`
**Problem:** On prod, image upload is a required field. TC_PN_19 skipped `uploadImage()`, so on submit the form blocked at image validation instead of custom link validation. `#customlink_error` never became visible → `waitFor({ state: 'visible' })` timed out.
**Fix:** Added `await pushNotificationPage.uploadImage('test-data/Amsterdam.png')` after `clickBlankSpace()` and before `clickCustomLinkOption()`.

## Fix 2 — TC_PN_03: `getActionMenuOptions()` returning items from hidden dropdowns

**File:** `pages/PushNotificationPage.ts`
**Problem:** The locator `//div[contains(@class,'menu-sub-dropdown')]//a[contains(@class,'menu-link')]` matched all `menu-sub-dropdown` elements on the page — the profile dropdown (My Profile, Privacy Policy, Log Out) and KTMenu's hidden duplicate of the actions dropdown were both included, producing 8 items instead of 3.
**Fix:** Added `if (await el.isVisible())` check inside `getActionMenuOptions()` so only items from the currently open/visible dropdown are collected.
